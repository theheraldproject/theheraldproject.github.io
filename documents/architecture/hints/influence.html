        <p>The <b>Influence</b> relationship represents that an element affects the implementation or achievement of some motivation element. </p>
        
        <p>The Influence relationship is used to describe that some architectural element influences achievement or implementation of a motivation element, such as a goal or a principle. In general, a motivation element is realized to a certain degree.</p>
        
        <p>Attributes can be used to indicate the sign and/or strength of the influence. The choice of possible attribute values is left to the modeler; e.g., {++, +, 0, -, --} or [0..10]. By default, the Influence relationship models a contribution with unspecified sign and strength.</p>

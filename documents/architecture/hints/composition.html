        <p>The <b>Composition relationship</b> indicates that an object consists of a number of other objects.</p>
        
        <p>The interpretation of a Composition relationship is that the whole or part of the source element is composed of the whole of the target element.</p>

        <p>A specific kind of server can be modeled as a node composed of a device and system software implying an existence dependency between individual servers of that kind and the individual devices and system software instances of which they consist.</p>

        <p>A Composition relationship is always allowed between two instances of the same element type.</p>

        <p>The <b>Specialization relationship</b> indicates that an object is a specialization of another object.</p>
        
        <p>A Specialization relationship is always allowed between two instances of the same element type.</p>

        <p>Alternatively, a Specialization relationship can be expressed by nesting the specialized element inside the generic element.</p>

        <p>An <b>Application Collaboration</b> represents an aggregate of two or more application internal active structure elements that work together to perform collective application behavior.</p>
        
        <p>An Application Collaboration specifies which Application Components or other Application Collaborations cooperate to perform some task. The collaborative behavior, including, for example, the communication pattern of these components, is modeled by an Application Interaction. An Application Collaboration typically models a logical or temporary collaboration of Application Components, and does not exist as a separate entity in the enterprise.</p>

        <p>Application Collaboration is a specialization of application internal active structure element, and aggregates two or more (cooperating) Application Components or other Application Collaborations.</p>

        <p>The name of an Application Collaboration should preferably be a noun.</p>

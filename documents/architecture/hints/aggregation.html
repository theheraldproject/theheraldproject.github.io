        <p>The <b>Aggregation relationship</b> indicates that a concept groups a number of other concepts.</p>
        
        <p>Unlike Composition, Aggregation does not imply an existence dependency between the aggregating and aggregated concepts.</p>
   	
        <p>Aggregation is always possible between two instances of the same element type.</p>

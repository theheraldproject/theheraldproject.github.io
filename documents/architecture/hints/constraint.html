        <p>A <b>Constraint</b> represents a factor that limits the realization of goals.</p>
        
        <p>In contrast to a requirement, a constraint does not prescribe some intended functionality of the system to be realized but imposes a restriction on the way it operates or may be realized. This may be a restriction on the implementation of the system (e.g., specific technology that is to be used), or a restriction on the implementation process (e.g., time or  budget constraints).</p>

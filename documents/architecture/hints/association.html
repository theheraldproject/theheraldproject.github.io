        <p>The <b>Association relationship</b> is always allowed between two elements, or between a relationship and an element.</p>
        
        <p>The Association relationship can be used when drawing a first high-level model where relationships are initially denoted in a generic way, and later refined to show more specific relationship types.</p>
        
        <p>An Association relationship is undirected by default but may be directed.</p>

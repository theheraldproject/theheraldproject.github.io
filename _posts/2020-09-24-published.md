We are pleased to announce the publication of an open source, reliable, Bluetooth protocol
called 'Herald', and our [Fair Efficacy Formula]({{"/efficacy" | relative_url }}) to enable the measurement and improvement of
all contact tracing applications.

The [Herald protocol]({{"/protocol" | relative_url }}) will be of use to those developing Contact Tracing applicatins, and any
other applications requiring reliable pair-wise bluetooth communication between
mobile devices. This overcomes many of the issues present in existing contact tracing apps
and Bluetooth approaches on mobile devices.

This was created in the spare time by researchers at [VMware, Inc.](https://www.vmware.com/)
and elsewhere and is now provided to the worldwide community!

The documentation on this site is available under the MIT license. The source code
to the protocol and fair efficacy analysis tools is available.

Please visit the [Home page]({{"/" | relative_url }}) for full details.

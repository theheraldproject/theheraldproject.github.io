Quite a few things have happened in the first month since Herald was published as Open Source Software
under the MIT license. [29 Nov 2020 NOTE: Code now under the Apache-2.0 license]

The most visible change is this website. A new theme based on our new project logo:-

<img src="../img/herald.png" alt="Herald logo" />

We've also modified the Herald library to allow for an 'immediate send' function. This is useful
for Bluetooth apps that use Herald for reliable communication and timed payloads, but
who also need to send time sensitive information to nearby devices. The new
optional callback surfaces this to the remote application.

Also added are two new communication channels: Slack and Twitter.

Our twitter handle is <a href="https://twitter.com/HeraldBluetooth" target="_new">@HeraldBluetooth</a> (there's a link in the footer of our website.).

We have our own Slack instance too to allow for protocol collaboration and joint research. This is available at 
<a href="https://herald-bluetooth.slack.com/" target="_new">https://herald-bluetooth.slack.com/</a>

Please join in with the development of Herald. We're planning our next 
formal release and so welcome any and all feedback you have.
